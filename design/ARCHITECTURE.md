#Haoma

##Personal Raspberry Pi Health Robot

#OS Layer

Raspberry Pi 2 bare metal running Ubuntu Snappy. We are designing a healthcare software system, not a single purpose application. 
From a design perspective, we want to favor composable components over large single function applications. 
We aim to support rapid development. 

#Haoma - AI Agent

Github's Hubot is a node js and coffee script chat bot framework.
Hubot supports a wide range of common bot functionality, including amusing chat plugins, 
developer tools, on demand script execution, etc... Hubot's can live on twitter, slack, irc, sms, etc...
Hubot also supports a large number of existing cloud databases, such as Firebase, Azure Blob Storage and Redis.

#Dashboard - Configuration and Monitoring

HaomaDashboard provides a realtime web application interface into Hubot's Firebase brain. 
The HaomaDashboard can be used for passive brain monitoring, or interactive brain manipulation, tied directly back with Ethereum.
Why? For permanent distributed secure storage. The Haoma agent is a command and chat based bridge between Firebase and Ethereum.
Hubot scripts define what information Haoma records and how it is stored in Ethereum by updating Firebase.
Potential applications include secure sample logging, ai agents, brokers etc...
Consider Haoma's Firebase Brain a realtime, collaborative, Ethereum package manger, 
installing whatever Haoma is thinking about, on a secure distributed app.

#Apps, Extension and Integration

Dockerized apps are the recommended way to extend the Firebase Brain for special reporting or processing purposes.
Firebase, can be used as a shared memory space, but raw binaries our other code may be better stored on a distributed FS.
Perhapse someone could recommend an Ethereum solution for Git?
